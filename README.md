# Mission to Mars

## Overview
This project consisted on a Python script to scrape text and images from various websites that talked about Mission to Mars. We created a Flask web application with a rendered HTML template designed using Bootstrap to display all the data in a central location. By using Bootstrap's grid system we were able to create a mobile responsive web app.
